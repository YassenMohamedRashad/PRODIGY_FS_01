# User Authentication System

This project implements a user authentication system with secure login and registration functionality. It ensures that users can sign up, log in securely, and access protected routes only after successful authentication. Additionally, it includes optional features for password hashing, session management, and user role-based access control.

## Features

- **User Registration:** Allows new users to create an account with unique credentials.
- **Secure Login:** Users can log in securely using their credentials.
- **Protected Routes:** Only authenticated users can access certain routes within the application.
- **Password Hashing:** User passwords are securely hashed before being stored in the database.
- **Session Management:** Ensures that user sessions are securely managed to prevent unauthorized access.
- **User Role-Based Access Control:** (Optional) Grants or restricts access to specific resources based on user roles.
